        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic to cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add the mince and stir with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince changes colour. Add tomato, wine and tomato paste and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove the heat and season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>For the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion, parsley stalks, peppercorns and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse</li>
            <li>Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the flour and cook, stirring until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan. Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until mixture is smooth. Gradually add the remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined</li>
            <li>Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove the heat. Add the parmesan and stir until cheese melts</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius. Brush a rectangular 3L capacity dish with oil to lightly grease. Spread one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagna sheet over the sauce. Top with one-third of the mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering with remaining lasagna sheets. Sprinkle with mozzarella</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until cheese melts and is golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes to set</li>
            <li>Cut the lasagna into 8 portions and serve with mixed salad leaves.</li>
