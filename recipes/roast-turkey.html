        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 boneless, skin-on turkey breast</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp groudn cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tbsp prepared pesto sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dried cranberries</li>
            <li>4 ounces ham, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>5 thin slices provolone cheese</li>
    
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees celcius. Grease a baking dish with vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Place turkey breast, skin-side down, on a work surface. Open it up and trim off any connective tissue. Cut at an angle along the natural seam of the turkey and butterfly it open so it's all about the same thickness; don't cut all the way through</li>
            <li>Season the turkey breast with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne. Spread dijon over the surface and then spread pesto over that. Scatter dried cranberries over top, then layer with ham and provolone cheese</li>
            <li>Roll turkey breast from one side to the other to enclose the filling, and flip so the skin is facing up. Tie around the center with a kitchen string to secure. Repeat ties at 1-inch intervals along the length of the roast all the way to each end. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Season the top and sides with remaining salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Roast in the center of the preheated oven until internal temperature reaches 65 degrees celcius, 1 Â½ to 2 hours</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Cut off strings and slice</li>
        </ol>
